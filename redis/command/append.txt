# Redis APPEND command examples

# Check firstkey, it not exist
127.0.0.1:6379> get firstkey
(nil)

# Append "abc" to the firstkey. 
# As firstkey does not already exist, so it will be created and "abc" will be appended to that.
# After append the length of firstkey value is three(3), so "3" is returned
127.0.0.1:6379> append firstkey "abc"
(integer) 3

# Check firstkey, we get "abc"
127.0.0.1:6379> get firstkey
"abc"

# Append "def" to firstkey.
# As firstkey already has "abc" as value, if "def" is appended then firstkey value becomes "abcdef".
# After append the total length of firstkey value is six(6) so "6" is returned as result.
127.0.0.1:6379> append firstkey "def"
(integer) 6

# Check firstkey, we get "abcded"
127.0.0.1:6379> get firstkey

# Check the length of firstkey and we get six(6)

(integer) 6

# Let's check with another key, secondkey, it is not set yet.
127.0.0.1:6379> get secondkey
(nil)

# Append a blank string "" to secondkey.
# secondkey will be create and blank sring "" will be appended to it.
# As a result the value os second key becomes a blank string "", and length becomes zero(0)
# Zero(0) is returned as result
127.0.0.1:6379> append secondkey ""
